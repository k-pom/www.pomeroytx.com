          <h4>Technology</h4>
          <div>
            Nothing captures my interest like the ever changing field of Technology. I enjoy
            <span class="more">more...</span>
            <span class="more_details">
              the idea of nothing ever being 'perfect' and always having to adapt to keep
              up with the latest trends and developments. My career and skill sets are mostly
              in application programming, though I also have experience with doing system 
              administration, API development, UI & UX design, as well as some basic networking
              and security. Programming language in order of preference / fluidity: Ruby, 
              Javascript (plus jQuery and nodejs), PHP, Python, Java. (add obligatory 
              HTML/CSS tags as well, even if they aren't a programming language)
            </span>
          </div>

          <h4>Family</h4>
          <div>
            I have been blessed with the coolest family ever. My awesome wife, Chelsi
            <span class="more">more...</span>
            <span class="more_details">
              and I were married in June of 2006, shortly after graduating. Since then, 
              we have had 3 children; Lee ('07), Amanda('08), and Jacob('10). Having a famliy
              full of very strong personalities means there is never a dull moment, and I enjoy
              it all. Well, at least until I lose to my 5 year old at my own games. 
            </span>
          </div>



          <h4>Art</h4>
          <div>
            While not an artist except by desire, I greatly appreciate writing, music, and 
            <span class="more">more...</span>
            <span class="more_details">
              to a lesser extent visual arts. It takes a truly special individual to take something 
              mundane like letters or noises and combine them in such a way to produce a thing
              that transcends boundaries like culture, age, and language. Though I can play a couple instruments and I write as time allows, I typically leave it to the true artists to create.

          <h4>Making Things</h4>
          <div>
            This deserves its own header. Nothing makes me more passionate than building
            <span class="more">more...</span>
            <span class="more_details">
              something new. This could be a application for a company, a magic deck I haven't 
              built before, a lego car with my kids, or fleshing out a brand new idea. I enjoy 
              the seeing a vague picture of what something might be, and working through building 
              it to see what it actually will be. The discovery of the path to success is a euphoric
              feeling that I have never found an equivalent for in any other activity.
            </span>
          </div>

          <h4>Gaming</h4>
          <div>
            A huge part of my free time is devoted to Gaming. Board games, card games,
            <span class="more">more...</span>
            <span class="more_details">
                miniature games, dice games, RPGs - I'll play them all. Games are a unique method 
                of entertainment and social interaction that can not be achieved in any other way.
                I enjoy the abstract thinking and complex decisions well designed games provide. 
                Current favorites include Legend of the Five Rings, Magic the Gathering, Settlers 
                of Catan, Warhammer 40k, and Lord of the Rings TCG.
